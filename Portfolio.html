                <h3>Project for Maintenance requests</h3>
                <p>o    This system is designed to manage maintenance requests in a production environment where machines experience downtime and workers’ downtime. When there is a stoppage in a machine on the production line, supervisor can submit a maintenance request through the system. The maintenance team receives the request, starts the maintenance cycle, logs their activities, and once the issue is resolved, they close the request. The system will track the downtime, machine status, and maintenance history, providing insights into machine performance and maintenance needs over time.
o   The goal of this project is to streamline the maintenance process, improve machine uptime, and track the lifecycle and performance of machines to predict maintenance needs and optimize the production line.
